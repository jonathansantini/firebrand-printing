            <li>What material should it be printed on? We offer clear, white, and several metallic options to complement the overall design of your product. All of our materials feature excellent adhesives that meet UL specifications.</li>
            <li class="mt-4">How much protection does your label need? Adding an overlaminate provides surface protection for the printing on your label. For maximum scratch and impact protection, choose polycarbonate; for excellent scratch protection, a gloss overlaminate will suffice. Labels without laminates are still durable and somewhat scratch resistant but a laminate can also add a more sophisticated appearance and texture in addition to protection from damage.</li>
